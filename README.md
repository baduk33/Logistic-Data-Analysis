# Logistic-Data-Analysis

This is an end-to-end logistics performance monitoring solution where I built a multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard to track delivery efficiency, hub performance, driver metrics, and vehicle utilization. I implemented DAX measures for KPI calculations and designed the data model for optimized performance.


##  Business Problem

Swift Route Logistics wanted to monitor:

* Delivery performance
* Driver efficiency
* Hub processing time
* Vehicle utilization
* Breakdown trends

The goal was to improve operational efficiency and reduce delays.
